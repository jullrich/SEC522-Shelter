<h1>SEC522 Animal Shelter</h1>
<h2>Where Good Dogs and Bad Cats Find Homes</h2>
<p>
    Recently, the staff noted that a lot of volunteers showed up to play with the cats, but nobody
    took care of the dogs. Looking at the calendar application, the staff noticed that someone
    appeared to have swapped the tasks assigned to volunteers by stealing OAUTH tokens. The
    hack was traced to a workstation in one of the cat rooms.
</p>
<p>
    The OAUTH tokens are stored in a SQL database. As part of the SQL Injection exercise, we
    learned that the <a href="http://www.sec522.org/sqlinjection/index.php">search page</a> was
    vulnerable to SQL injection. Can you come up with an exploit to read the OAUTH tokens?
    In addition to fixing the SQL injection issues, are there other ways to mitigate this problem?
